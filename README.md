# Generative-AI-for-Demystifying-Legal-Documents
Python + Flask Project


# Legal Document Simplifier

This project uses **Generative AI** (transformers) with a **Flask** web app to simplify legal documents into plain, accessible language. Users can upload legal documents, choose explanation complexity (Very Basic ‚Üí Advanced), select their preferred language (English, Hindi, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, etc.), and ask interactive Q\&A questions about the document.

## Societal Benefits

‚úÖ Legal Accessibility ‚Äî Empowers average citizens to interpret rental agreements, loan contracts, and terms of service without requiring specialized legal literacy.

‚úÖ Consumer Protection ‚Äî Highlights obligations, risks, and penalty clauses that are often obscured in dense contractual text.

‚úÖ Linguistic Inclusivity ‚Äî Bridges the gap for non-English speakers by providing localized explanations in their native language.

‚úÖ Educational Utility ‚Äî Assists students, paralegals, and small business owners in learning contractual norms and legal reasoning.

‚úÖ Democratization of Legal Knowledge ‚Äî Reduces dependency on costly legal intermediaries for basic interpretative tasks.

## Requirements

### Python version

* Python **3.9+** recommended

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt`:

```
flask==2.2.5
transformers==4.50.0
datasets==2.10.1
torch>=1.13.0

```

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/legal-ai-flask-project.git
cd legal-ai-flask-project
```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. **Install requirements**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Ensure folder structure is correct**

```bash
mkdir -p data/uploads
# Keep folder tracked by Git
touch data/uploads/.gitkeep
```

---

## Running the Application

### Development mode

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Production mode (Gunicorn)

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

---

## Usage

1. Navigate to the web app home page.
2. Upload a legal document (PDF/TXT).
3. Choose explanation level:

   * Very Basic (child-friendly)
   * Medium (simple, clear)
   * Intermediate (moderately detailed)
   * Advanced (technical clarity)
4. Choose output language.
5. View simplified explanations clause by clause.
6. Ask questions about the document using the built-in Q\&A.

---

## Sample Data

* `data/sample_legal_docs/` contains example contracts.
* `data/annotations.jsonl` provides fine-tuning data with text-summary pairs.

Example from `annotations.jsonl`:

```json
{"text": "The tenant agrees to pay monthly rent of $1,200 by the 5th of each month.", "summary": "You must pay $1,200 rent by the 5th of each month."}
```

---

## Fine-tuning (Optional)

To fine-tune on your dataset:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

This will train a summarization model on `data/annotations.jsonl` and save it under `./finetuned-model/`.

---

## Git Setup for Uploads

To avoid committing user-uploaded documents, `.gitignore` includes:

```gitignore
# Ignore uploaded user files
data/uploads/*
# Keep empty folder
!data/uploads/.gitkeep
```

---

## Demo Script (Step-by-Step)

1. Start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
3. Upload a sample file from `data/sample_legal_docs/`.
4. Choose explanation level (e.g., Very Basic).
5. Choose language (e.g., Hindi).
6. View simplified results.
7. Ask: *‚ÄúWhat happens if I don‚Äôt pay on time?‚Äù* in the Q\&A box.

---

## Notes

* Some translations rely on Hugging Face MarianMT; not all languages may be equally strong.
* Long documents may be chunked; very large contracts may take longer.
* For production, deploy with Gunicorn + Nginx (or Cloud Run).

---

## Future Extensions

‚öôÔ∏è Clause Risk Classification ‚Äî Highlight unfair terms and risky obligations.

üîç Regulatory Compliance Checker ‚Äî Map clauses against jurisdictional compliance benchmarks.

üìä Explainability Layer ‚Äî Provide attention-visualization for model interpretability.

‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Native Deployment ‚Äî Containerization via Docker + deployment on Google Cloud Run or Kubernetes.

## Conclusion

This project operationalizes AI-driven legal simplification with a focus on human accessibility, linguistic equity, and social empowerment. By bridging the gap between legal complexity and public comprehension, it enhances transparency, reduces exploitation risks, and contributes to a more informed civil society.
